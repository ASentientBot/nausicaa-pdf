# Nausicaä scans processing

My script to process [Rrobynne](https://desuarchive.org/a/thread/198080742)'s excellent _Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind_ scans; results are significantly better (imo) than existing torrents. I've focused on fixing alignment and contrast while retaining very high quality.

The script is mostly auto-generated.
